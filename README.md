# CarBookingSystem

This is a CLI Project using Java where I make a Backend Application for a Car Booking System

It is a Car booking system with 6 features:
1️⃣ - Book Car
2️⃣ - View All User Booked Cars
3️⃣ - View All Bookings
4️⃣ - View Available Cars
5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars
6️⃣ - View all users
7️⃣ - Exit

This project is for me to practice N-tier architecture, Interfaces, Dependency Injection, Lists, Streams, Maven, Tests, and Spring Boot
